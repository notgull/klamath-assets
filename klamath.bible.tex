\section{Introduction} 
This is a design document for my idea of a "Detective Klamath" animated series. This document contains the ideas of the history, general structure of episode and series, and overarching themes for a cartoon with themes regarding the hardships involved in the creation process, as well as urban warfare and irony.

If you have received this document, it is likely you're working directly on Detective Klamath with me, notgull. If you are, please do not share this document, as it could spoil the series or affect the audience's perception of it.

\subsection{General Overview}

Detective Klamath is a comedy-drama, starring the titular gooian Detective Klamath Tellth attempting to single-handedly bring down a conspiracy involving Reno nuclear energy magnate Roth Darkmond taking control of Reno's economy. Despite having his private-eye license revoked after a previous attempt to confront Darkmond and being overall ill-prepared to fight the conspiracy, he persists on regardless. He is assisted by his best friend and roommate Dr. Jack Chester, a lazy inventor and scientist. He is both allied with and against Officer Shirley Signage, a police officer involved in Klamath's antics in the past who holds a pessimistic view on life in general. Early on in the series, Darkmond hires the incompetent hitman Thomas Clearway to prevent Klamath from pursuing the truth regarding his conspiracy. Occasionally, they are joined by Klamath and Jack's landlord, Metalman, a boomer Vietnam veteran. These characters make up the series' main cast.

Detective Klamath is set in a world where, after a long series of alien invasions, animal uprisings, and AI takeovers, humanity is now living alongside a litany of various other races in relative harmony. In the town of Reno, Nevada, humans are still dominant, although various other races still live alongside them. This harmony is kept by the shadowy Upper Council, a group consisting of important figures from these various races that keep the general populace in check.

Each episode should consist of Klamath following a lead, often with the help of Chester or Shirley. Thomas attempts to use the lead to his advantage to kill Klamath. However, the characters inevitably encounters some kind of faux-pa that spirals into the main conflict of the episode. Klamath attempts to use something demonstrated earlier in the episode to resolve the conflict, but this only makes it worse. However, something subtly hinted at even earlier in the episode causes the end resolution of the central conflict. In the course of this conflict, Klamath loses any evidence of the conspiracy and is forced to start over.

In the first season, Klamath quits his reporting job and attempts to find evidence of the Darkmond conspiracy in order to prevent it from taking over Reno. Halfway through the season, Klamath's older brother Donald comes and tries to convince Klamath to stop following the, in his eyes, false conspiracy and return to stable employment; however, he notices evidence of the conspiracy and decides to follow it instead. Before Klamath can accumulate even a single piece of evidence, Donald finds evidence of antitrust violations and attempts to bring it to the eyes of the city's mayor. However, the mayor is, in fact, controlled by Darkmond, and Darkmond assassinates Donald during the meeting. Klamath uses his brother's last words as well as the help of a local antitrust agent to finally expose Darkmond. However, in a final shootout with Darkmond, Klamath fatally injures Darkmond at the last second before he can get away. This incident gives Klamath credibility and rises him to mild fame and fortune.

In the second season, Klamath begins to take on odd detective work while he mourns for his brother and keeps a sneaking suspicion that Darkmond wasn't at the top of the food chain. As he resolves these odd jobs, he finds shards of evidence of an "Upper Council" that may have controlled Darkmond from behind the scenes; in fact, the "Upper Council" seems to have hired Thomas to kill Klamath. However, he has an even harder time finding evidence than he did for the Darkmond conspiracy. After Shirley is killed in a shootout that Klamath suspects to be tied to the Upper Council, his suspicions multiply, and his work eventually brings him to an abandoned cabin in the middle of the desert. Here he meets messengers of the Upper Council, who tell him there is a bomb underneath his house that it set to detonate the entire city. He goes back to Reno and finds the bomb defended by Jack, who has been hired by the Upper Council. A fight with Jack leaves Klamath fatally wounded, and he stops the bomb's detonation by shooting himself and then covering the bomb's innards with the goo he is made out of. It should be unclear whether or not the events of the series finale are entirely Klamath's imagination or not.

\section{History}

This section details the history of the world and how it should show through in the series proper.

\subsection{Pre-Invasion}

The timeline of Klamath diverges from our own in 1800. After the French Revolution and American Revolution, the aristocrats of Europe begin to fear that democracies may one day overtake monarchies, essentially dissolving their power. To combat this, they pool their resources and create an elite team of assassins in order to dissolve democracies. These assassins kill Napoleon Bonaparte and cause the end of his empire long before he can stand as a threat.

The revolutions of 1848 lead to these assassins being used more often, even if their assassinations often failed at the intended effect of stopping the reformations. This causes the group to grow in power, until they establish the Upper Council, essentially superseding the monarchies they were originally founded to protect. The Upper Council, in addition to covertly assassinating rulers that stepped out of their line, established institutions of science in order to gain a leg up on the working population.

By the 1900's, the Upper Council's sciences were leagues ahead of contemporary science. Their astronomy division had conclusively identified several alien civilization and even begun to communicate with them. Meanwhile, its biology division had created a number of drugs that could modify the human body to incredible degrees. One of these drugs was Sensodryme, which could exponentially increase the intelligence of a human subject. These drugs were used to microdose rulers to either keep them in power or depose them. Meanwhile, its computing division had invented computers, and were able to use them to simulate world affairs.

With the commencement of World Wars, the Upper Council used its influence to determine which side won the war. Realizing that it could now control a democracy more than a monarchy, it established front companies in the west in order to supply it with a steady drip of weapon advancements. With their help, the western democracies easily win both wars. These front companies remained and supported the Upper Council with a steady supply of profits.

In the series, the Upper Council would likely be behind the events of Season 2, after Klamath successfully defeats Darkmond and attracts their attention. Make sure to sew doubt whether or not the Upper Council is even real or just a figment of Klamath's imagination, trying to come up with a bigger fish of a conspiracy to solve.

\subsection{The First Invasions}

In the early 1950's, the Upper Council began to realize that the relative peace after World War 2 was causing it to lose its grip on the world and, potentially, could lead to one of its puppets rebelling against it. After some early lab trials in a laboratory in Carson City, they decided to enact the Couscous Protocol: to create another intelligent species in order to divide humanity. One of the pharmaceutical front companies, Jasper, underwent an industrial accident and began leaking Sensodryme into the swamps of Florida. Predictably, this caused the crocodiles of Florida to mutate into higher, more intelligent beings. Before the leak was discovered, the new crocodile people were supplied with weapons and technology by the Upper Council, who, in exchange, put their representatives in the Council's seats.

The crocodile people staged a rebellion against humanity, carving out a territory in lower Florida for their civilization. Meanwhile, the Upper Council began to enact the Coucous Protocol for other populations of animals, such as bear people in the Soviet Union, giraffe people in Africa, and penguin people in Antartica, began staging their own rebellions. Humanity at large was shocked, and generally united in war against these new kingdoms.

Meanwhile, the Upper Council notified the aliens in regards to the current war. Some decided to intervene on the side of the humanity or one of the new animal factions, or opportunistically took advantage of the chaos in an attempt to take Earth for themselves.

\subsection{Initial Animal Scrimishes}

At the beginning of the war, the human forces, still in disparate countries, had the advantage. The United States managed to push the alligator forces deep into Florida, while the Soviet Union proceeded to engage in inhumanitarian efforts against the bears.

However, the war began to shift once the alligators began carrying Sensodryme to other swamp areas in the Americas, even extended down as far as Brazil. They became ingrained into the swamps by using a form of guerilla warfare that made any intrusion into these swamps nearly impossible. America started using napalm on the swamps, but this was quickly countered by a long-range missile developed the the alligators that took out planes from outside of their range. Although enthusiasm for the war, fostered by American science fiction propoganda for the public, was initially overflowing, the war effort became exhausted as the alligators turned the war into one of attrition.

Meanwhile, the Metalmen of Dosi 13 had rushed to Earth and allied with the bears in order to carve out a territory in Siberia. The Metalmen's technology, combined with that of the Upper Council, allowed the bears to establish an unprecedented industrial complex in their territory. Although they were unable to out-industrialize the Soviet Union, their numbers and usage of guerilla warfare allowed them to push back the combined Sino-Soviet army. In addition, the penguin people of Antartica had seized warships near the Antartic and established themselves as a terrifying effective navy. Seeing their cause as united, they allied with both the bear and the alligators in order to prevent their respective human forces from gaining an advantage at sea.

In addition, the giraffe people quickly attained the technology to effectively control the heartland of Africa. They began to cross the Mediterranean sea, preventing the European countries from sending aid to the United States, further exhausting their efforts. However, a misapplication of Sensodryme gave the cheetas sapience as well, and they entered into war with the giraffes.

By the end of 1952, the humans appeared to be ahead in the war. The American countries had largely isolated the alligator threat to the southern United States and upper Mexico, even without navy support, and the combined bear/Metalmen forces underwent diplomatic conflicts and essentially infighting. The giraffe/cheeta infighting had also reduced their effectiveness.

However, the entire landscape of the conflict was changed when the Gooians and the Grayheads began their invasion.

\subsection{Gooian and Grayhead Intervention}

The Metalmen were a larger empire than either the Gooians or the Grayheads; however, they were not interested in Earth. The Metalmen who had came to Earth were actually commanded by a rogue general who had taken his smaller force in an attempt to claim Earth for himself. However, the Gooians and Grayheads took their entire force to Earth.

The Gooians arrived first, and planted their forces in Eastern Europe. With their superior numbers and alien weaponry, combined with their ability to use their spaceships to flush out the penguin navy, expanded into Russia and Western Europe, being stopped at the Berlin Wall by the Western forces and stopped at the boundary of Siberia by the combined bear/Metalmen forces. The Soviet military, already depleted by the years of warfare with the bears, was almost completely destroyed. The Soviet leaders were forced to flee to the nearby European nations, already under siege by a combined giraffe/penguin assault.

Meanwhile, the Grayheads planted themselves into Canada and South America. Since the South American nations had donated most of their militaries to the Americas and to Europe, they were very swiftly overwhelmed. However, the territory that the Crocdile people had captured was in this territory. The Grayheads were extraordinarily brutal, and this surprised the Crocodiles. Thus, they declared war on the Grayheads too.

At this stage in the war, chances appreared very grim for humanity. Most of the world's landmass had been occupied by foreign powers. America was fighting a two front war between the Crocodiles and the Grayheads. The remains of the forces in Western Europe were fighting the Gooians and the forces of Africa, although the Gooians were also fighting the combined Bear-Metalmen forces and the African forces were not as united as they seemed.

\subsection{A United Humanity}

Australia had remained largely untouched by both alien and animal forces. Although some of the Giraffe forces had begun water assaults, the Penguin people largely did not give them their support after some diplomatic failings and humanity was still dominant in the continent.

In desperation, the remaining human governments formed a single-government treaty and covertly moved their nuclear missiles to Australia. This was allowed by the Upper Council, as the war had quickly escalated out of their hands and they wanted a more decisive end to it. There were five original targets: the motherships belonging to the Grayheads, Gooians, and Metalmen, the Penguin capital in Antartica and the Grayhead capital in Brazil.

However, the Gooians had managed to intercept the plan. Strategically, they sent in a covert spy unit that disarmed the missile aimed towards their mothership. The rest of the missiles hit their intended targets. This essentially halted the Grayhead's expansion, as well as the Penguin's navy support and dissolved the already tenuous Bear-Metalman alliance. The Crocodiles opportunistically began taking territory in Central America back while the Grayheads recoiled.

The Single-Government President made a statement threatening to destroy the remaining capitals of the invasive forces if a peace treaty was not made involving the Grayheads and Gooians completely leaving Earth and the animal forces taking humiliating territorial concessions. This was seen as an act of intense aggression, but had the intended effect. The Grayheads began to move out of Canada, even if the Gooians had begun to take their place.

Unbeknownst to the rest of the combatants, the Grayheads were not here to conquer. Their "mothership" was actually their last remaining colony ship, after their planet had fallen to an intergalactic conqueror. With their only hope of retreating from Earth destroyed, they were now fighting for survival. Seeing this, the Upper Council approached them in order to make a deal.

\subsection{The Sinking of Australia}

The Upper Council had enacted the Couscous Protocol in the efforts of gaining control, but instead had completely lost it by 1961. Nearly every side of the war was fighting every other side; even the animal forces had turned on eachother. The humans were threatening to nuke most of the world, and the Crocodiles and Bears had found nuclear missiles as well and were making similar threats. They decided upon a plan that would frame the Grayheads.

They presented the Grayhead leadership with a seismic device, capable of leveling entire continents, developed by their R\&D teams. It could easily be presented as alien technology. Using their last flying saucer, the Grayheads would plant the device in Australia, sinking it.

The plan worked. Since every side in the war had thrown their entire military at Australia, the casualties were catastrophic. It is estimated that over three billion sapient entities died when the continent crumbled up and sank into the ocean. It was a truly sobering moment that every side in the war felt.

Now with everyone under their control, the Upper Council began work on their peace treaty.

\subsection{The Peace Treaty}

The world would be divided up by their approximate conquered territories. Canada and the United States became largely populated by Gooians, Grayheads, Crocodiles, and the remaining humans. Central and South America was divided between the Crocodiles, Penguins, and Grayheads. Africa was largely controlled by animal forces, alongside the remaining human countries who had survived the war. Western Europe was almost entirely human, while Eastern Europe became almost entirely Gooian. Asia was populated in large by Gooians, Metalmen, and animals.

Each side had a lingering resentment towards the other. Terrorist attacks in defiance of the new world order became common. However, by the 1980's, in the process of interbreeding and exchanging ideas, the races became more accustomed to eachother. Cultures were interchanged, technology was improved, and it seemed as if world peace was settling in.

Of course, this was largely due to the Upper Council enforcing their control over nearly aspect of society. But no one seemed to notice or even care.

\subsection{What Actually Matters To The Series}

The Upper Council installs Roth Darkmond to control Reno. Reno is strategically important to the Upper Council as it contains one of the highest amounts of race diversity in the world, making it a center for political power. Officially, Darkmond is the proprietor of the local power plant. Unofficially, Darkmond is slowly expanding his control over the entirety of Reno.

Klamath Tellth, the son of two Gooian immigrants and amateur private eye, begins to suspect that there is a conspiracy when a mathematical error occurs in his electrical bill. He originally suspects that the Zirconium Corporation, run largely by Metalmen, is responsible for the conspiracy. During his investigation and resulting gunfire incidents, he largely wipes out the Zirconium Corporation's leadership, allowing Darkmond to expand his control even furhter.

Klamath, now enraged, decides to try to expose Darkmond's evil schemes, but appears insane and humiliates himself, losing most of his private eye business. With help from his brother, he managed to find work as a fluff journalist. However, he accidentally witnesses Darkmond executing a rival businessman and deciedes to resume his investigations.

\section{Style}

Detective Klamath should have a style, even if said style is "scuffed".

\subsection{Visual}

Characters should be visually very simple and reducible to a few common shapes. Try to avoid creating visual noise. This is accomplished by contrasting the characters against their backgrounds. The colors and style of a character should be different from that of the background.

\subsection{Musical}

Music should use the symbols and the saxophone as motifs, in order to create a candied version of the 1920's noir asthetic.

\subsection{Writing}

\section{Characters}

Each character in Detective Klamath should serve an important role in the series, providing either levity, comedy, drama, or plot advancement. They are described below, along with how they should be used.

\subsection{Klamath}

Klamath Tellth was born to a pair of immigrants who came from the Gooian homeworld of Sigma 9.

\section{Overall Plot}

The following describes the overarching plot of Detective Klamath.

\section{Episodes}

Detective Klamath should have 2 seasons, with about 10 episodes per season. The first 5 episodes establish a pattern, and the next 5 break it.
